		<span>Summary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
		<span><p>A limited study of physicians in the United Kingdom&#8217;s National Health Service found that they are resistant to using algorithm-based tools, including AI-based applications. The research, which consisted of interviews with 32 physicians, identified four reasons for their reluctance. This article suggests ways their resistance can be overcome.</p>

								<p>Algorithm-based technologies, including AI applications, in health care can provide <a href="https://feedx.net/2018/05/how-health-care-changes-when-algorithms-start-making-diagnoses">incredibly accurate predictions and diagnoses</a> for a plethora of diseases and can educate physicians in real time about treatments they might not be familiar with. For example, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ntwe.12133">recent research</a> that I conducted with colleagues shows that physicians can use mobile apps for timely, high-speed access to online repositories of information about infrequently used drugs.</p>
