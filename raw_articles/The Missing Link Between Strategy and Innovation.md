		<span>Summary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
		<span><p>In too many companies, an innovation team is allowed to pursue its own agenda and imagine itself to be a separate island from the rest of the company. The results are always disappointing: a lot of creative ideas, but a failure to deliver meaningful growth. The root problem is the disconnect between strategy and innovation. To succeed, corporate innovation needs to be bounded by a clear set of strategic priorities that matter to the business. And it needs to play to the strengths of the firm &#8212; whether data, customer relationships, or supply chains &#8212; that will enable it to outcompete others attempting the same idea. The author offers five steps to help embed strategy into the innovation process.</p>
