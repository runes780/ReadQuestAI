		<span>Summary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
		<span><p>Remote work offers many benefits, but the lack of community &#8211; compared to in-person environments &#8211; can cause some workers to feel isolated and lonely. These feelings can impact job performance, sometimes significantly. This article will share four evidence-based strategies that leaders and managers can use to build community in their remote teams. These strategies include reflecting on what&#8217;s working for your team, recognizing your team in a meaningful way, providing support for career development, and communicating with your team as a whole person. Building a community in a remote environment requires innovation and intention, but getting started only takes one act.</p>

								<p>Remote work, as many of us know, can be isolating. That isolation often leads to feelings of loneliness, which can cause employees stress and significantly impact their job performance. Absenteeism attributed to stress and loneliness costs U.S. employers an estimated <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf">$154 billion annually</a>, according to a 2022 article published in the <em>Journal of Organizational Effectiveness: People and Performance</em>. Loneliness and isolation have had such a widespread impact on society over the last five years that public health officials have declared the situation an epidemic. Central to this crisis is a lack of community.</p>
