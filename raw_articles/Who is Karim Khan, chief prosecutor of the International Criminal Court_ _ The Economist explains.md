The British barrister will need those qualities as he confronts the political firestorm that he caused by <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/05/20/the-iccs-threat-to-arrest-binyamin-netanyahu-has-shocked-israel">applying for arrest warrants</a> for Israel’s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and defence minister, Yoav Gallant, as well as three leaders of Hamas.

The warrants will not be issued unless they are approved by <small>ICC</small> judges.
