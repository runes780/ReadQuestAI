								<p>It has been nearly three decades since Clay Christensen first introduced the concepts of disruptive innovation in his classic HBR article, <a href="https://feedx.net/1995/01/disruptive-technologies-catching-the-wave">“Disruptive Technologies: Catching the Wave,”</a> followed by his seminal book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Dilemma-Technologies-Management-Innovation/dp/1633691780/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2H4CMJ14QRKU4&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.8VtRv8pDDIB0iz50nbtUmfHh54fFQLZQfPB4Qe4LZ4egxOc9QXZhhpFHp2xH_gQH4IMalrrTM-Yj06EDtC90OLpUkYNRSApOWyfJnn4Wdd0W94yVetBZCzg1Gt_xCfOjUEG3ZxPiqQKVkER41h6x0Zoq55B_FamGIw9R-g4ZRd-3vHRfrbzk6xZs1f4_2dXULEG0lSEuG5qsNayDAV5le9ZNRlyzOYr4qryvikdxSmE.C2QMpxRqbUwt8MDBMmWdP1ugZaryHLWBhlrUkcthryQ&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=the+innovator%27s+dilemma&amp;qid=1709316169&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=the+innovator%27s+dilemma%2Cstripbooks%2C83&amp;sr=1-1"><em>The Innovator’s Dilemma</em></a>. While he initially defined disruption as an innovation or new technology that comes in at the low end of an existing market at a lower price and with some performance tradeoffs, Christensen <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/new-market-disruption">eventually broadened the concept</a> to include innovations with the potential to create a new market or reinvent an existing one.</p>
