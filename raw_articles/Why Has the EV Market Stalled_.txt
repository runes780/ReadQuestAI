		<span>Summary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
		<span><p>Surprisingly, the EV market has stalled in recent years. Why? Because the market has reached a difficult point in the technology-adoption lifecycle. Specifically, automakers and policymakers alike can no longer make plans based on what early adopters of EVs want. Instead, if they want to boost sales and reach a much broader segment of the market, they&#8217;re going to have to cater to a different set of interests and concerns &#8212; which will probably mean offering consumers more hybrids and plug-ins as a bridge to an all-electric future.</p>

								<p>A couple of years ago, we seemed to be hurtling toward an electric-car future. Tesla had reached a trillion-dollar market cap; Hertz had signed a $4 billion deal with Tesla to supply cars for its rental fleet; the Biden Administration had announced plans to make EVs comprise 50% of all new vehicles sold by 2030; and GM had committed itself to achieving 100% EV sales by 2035.</p>
