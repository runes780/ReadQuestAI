The law would have allowed state judges to order migrants to return to <b>Mexico</b>—and state police to arrest those suspected of crossing the border illegally. Earlier, Mexico said it would refuse to accept migrants deported by Texas.</p><hr /><p>The <b>Biden administration</b> announced what it billed as the “strongest-ever” rules on <b>vehicle pollution</b>. Under the rules carmakers must meet increasingly strict limits on the pollution cars can emit, which should boost sales of electric and hybrid cars. While Mr Biden hopes to impress climate-conscious voters, Mr Trump regularly uses the shift towards electric vehicles to fearmonger about the loss of American auto jobs.</p><hr /><p>Bernie Moreno, Donald Trump’s preferred candidate, won the Republican nomination for one of <b>Ohio’s </b>Senate seats, showcasing the power of the former president’s endorsement.

He will face Sherrod Brown, one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the <b>Senate</b>, in November’s election. </p><hr /><p>Two retired generals who worked to get American troops and civilians out of <b>Afghanistan</b> in August 2021 said the <b>Biden administration</b> inadequately planned the evacuation.

They also said the State Department did not begin the evacuation fast enough. </p><hr /><p>A state senator in <b>Arizona </b>announced in a floor speech that she was planning an <b>abortion </b>because her pregnancy was “not viable”. Eva Burch, a Democrat, later said she shared her news to highlight how the state’s abortion policies “impact people in practice”. <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/03/19/fewer-states-allow-abortions-yet-american-women-are-having-more">Abortion</a> after 15 weeks of pregnancy is illegal in Arizona; the state’s Supreme Court is considering whether a near-total ban from the 19th century should take precedence over the current law.</p><hr /><p>Two former police officers in <b>Mississippi</b> were sentenced to a combined 37 years in prison for <b>torturing</b> and sexually assaulting two black men and shooting one of them in the mouth. They are two of six ex-officers, all of whom are white, to plead guilty to a total of 13 felonies in August.
