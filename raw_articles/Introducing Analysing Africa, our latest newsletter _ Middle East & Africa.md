As the only region forecasted to have a growing working-age population in the coming decades, Africa and its people will become increasingly influential in an otherwise ageing global economy. The continent is home to many of the critical minerals and natural resources that will be needed in the green transition. Its increasing geopolitical clout is giving it more of a voice in international affairs, while its booming population of youngsters is reshaping culture everywhere.</p>
