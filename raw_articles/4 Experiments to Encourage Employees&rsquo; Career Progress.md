		<span>Summary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
		<span><p>The authors worked with 15 organizations and over 7,000 employees to experiment with ways to increase internal career development opportunities and prove promotion isn&#8217;t the only way people can advance. They found that when organizations enable ways to progress that go beyond promotion, it unlocks the flow of talent, skills, and strengths. Employees gain opportunities to grow, develop in different directions, and increase their career resilience. In summary, everyone wins. In this article, they share four experiments that unlock career progression.</p>

								<p>Career development that relies on promotions frequently creates challenges for managers. When promotions aren’t possible for employees ready to advance, managers are left feeling powerless without alternative options. This creates a lose-lose scenario: Employees’ careers start to stall, and managers are more likely to see team members leave the organization.</p>
