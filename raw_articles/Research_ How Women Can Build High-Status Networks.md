		<span>Summary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
		<span><p>Despite the potential career benefits of building high-status networks, research has long shown that women face greater obstacles in establishing these networks compared to men. <span>The authors&#8217; research</span>, published in the Academy of Management Journal, not only underscores what we know about the unique challenges women face in building high-status networks; it also offers a strategic roadmap for overcoming these challenges. By understanding and leveraging the power of shared social connections, women as individuals can navigate around systemic biases and forge valuable professional ties that propel their careers forward. For organizations committed to gender equality, their study provides a clear directive: Invest in building network sponsor programs that recognize and use the distinct pathways through which women can achieve high-status connections.</p>

								<p>In the context of career advancement, the notion that “It’s not <em>what</em> you know, but <em>who</em> you know” holds some truth. However, for many women, this concept presents unique challenges. Despite the potential career benefits of building high-status connections within an organization, research has long shown that women face greater obstacles in establishing such connections compared to men. <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amj.2021.0218">Our research</a>, published in the Academy of Management Journal, offers new insights into this persistent challenge, and we share some of those insights in this article.</p>
