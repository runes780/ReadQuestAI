		<span>Summary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
		<span><p>There are many use cases for generative AI, spanning a vast number of areas of domestic and work life. Looking through thousands of comments on sites such as Reddit and Quora, the author&#8217;s team found that the use of this technology is as wide-ranging as the problems we encounter in our lives. The 100 categories they identified can be divided into six top-level themes, which give an immediate sense of what generative AI is being used for: Technical Assistance &#38; Troubleshooting (23%), Content Creation &#38; Editing (22%), Personal &#38; Professional Support (17%), Learning &#38; Education (15%), Creativity &#38; Recreation (13%), Research, Analysis &#38; Decision Making (10%).</p>
