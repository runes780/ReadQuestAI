Here is a reading comprehension passage based on the text:

**Passage**

In July last year, security-camera footage captured a terrifying scene at a liquor store in Bucktown, a wealthy neighborhood in Chicago. Masked men burst into the store, pointing guns at customers and employees. The owner of the business, Diptesh Patel, recalled that one of the robbers waved his weapon furiously while shouting "Give us all of the money!" Suddenly, an employee behind the counter disappeared from view, and shards of glass or liquid filled the screen. It was later revealed that he had been shot in the stomach.

But this was no ordinary robbery. According to an indictment unsealed in federal court in Chicago on May 17th, some of the "victims" were actually paid actors who participated in the staged robbery. The robbery was one of 16 organized by the defendants, mostly in the Chicago area but also in Tennessee and Louisiana. The purpose of these robberies, prosecutors alleged, was to allow the purported victims to apply for U-visas.
