# Purim â€” a festive Jewish holiday with an ending often ignored

Purim is a festive Jewish holiday commemorating the salvation of the Jewish people from a plot to annihilate them, as recounted in the Book of Esther. The story revolves around a young Jewish woman named Esther who becomes queen of Persia and, with the help of her cousin Mordecai, foils a plan by the evil advisor Haman to exterminate the Jewish population. The holiday is marked by feasting, exchanging gifts, and giving to the poor.

During the festivities, Jews read the Book of Esther, called the Megillah, aloud in synagogues, often with humorous sound effects and costumes. One lesser-known aspect of the story is the aftermath of the Jews' victory. After the plot is thwarted, the Jewish people are granted permission to defend themselves against their enemies, resulting in a significant number of casualties among those who sought to harm them. This aspect of the story is particularly poignant in light of ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, where the right to self-defense remains a critical issue.

Purim is a time of celebration and reflection for Jews around the world, reminding them of their resilience in the face of adversity and the importance of standing up against injustice. By retelling the story of Esther and Mordecai each year, the holiday reinforces the values of courage, unity, and faith in the face of danger.
