# Ultra-Orthodox Jewish women are staging a sex-strike _ United States

In Aristophanes’s play “Lysistrata”, a young Athenian woman leads a movement where women from warring Greek states refuse to have sex with their partners as a protest against the ongoing war. This action causes conflict between the sexes, with men expressing frustration at taming women. 

More than two thousand years later, women in Kiryas Joel, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community near New York City, are following a similar path. Led by Adina Sash, these women are staging a sex strike to challenge a religious system where men can keep women in unwanted marriages by withholding a document called a “get”, which signifies the end of a marriage according to Jewish law.

One woman, Malky Berkowitz, has been seeking a “get” for four years, but her husband has refused to grant it despite religious authorities' involvement. Similar stories of women being “chained” to unwanted marriages exist globally, with efforts to address this issue legally varying from country to country.

In Kiryas Joel, where reporting domestic violence requires permission from a rabbi, the women have resorted to a sex strike as a last resort to push for change. While some voices within the community oppose this tactic, others see it as a necessary step to raise awareness and challenge the status quo.

The story of “Lysistrata” serves as a backdrop to the modern-day actions of these women, highlighting the power of unity and protest in seeking justice and change.
