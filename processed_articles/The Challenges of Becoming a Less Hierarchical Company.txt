In today's fast-paced business environment, many organizations are shifting towards flatter, less hierarchical structures in order to foster collaboration, enhance agility, and empower employees. However, a recent study conducted at a food processing company in Colombia sheds light on the challenges that companies may encounter when attempting to transition to a new organizational model. The research, led by the company's CEO and a team of experts, identifies various structural and interpersonal factors that leaders should be mindful of as they embark on restructuring initiatives.

Last year, Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg declared 2023 as the "Year of Efficiency" in a company-wide communication, emphasizing the benefits of a flatter organizational hierarchy. Zuckerberg emphasized that reducing layers in a hierarchy can lead to quicker decision-making processes and smoother information flow, as excessive levels of hierarchy tend to introduce delays and foster risk aversion within the organization.

As companies strive to adapt to the evolving demands of the business landscape, understanding and navigating these structural and human dynamics become crucial for successful organizational transformation.
