Karim Khan has been appointed as the new Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC). In his first major decision, he applied for arrest warrants for Israel's Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three leaders of Hamas. Mr. Khan believes that they are responsible for crimes against humanity and war crimes, including the use of "starvation as a weapon of war". The application has sparked controversy and condemnation from many Western politicians, including President Joe Biden.

The decision is part of a larger conflict that began after Hamas massacred Israeli communities near Gaza on October 7th. The ICC judges must approve the warrants before they are issued. Mr. Khan has also taken on other high-profile cases, including issuing an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for alleged war crimes committed during the invasion of Ukraine.
