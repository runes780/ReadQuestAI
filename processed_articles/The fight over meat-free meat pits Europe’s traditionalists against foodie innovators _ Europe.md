**Title:** The Great Meat Debate: France's Decree on Meat Labels Sparks Outrage among Vegan Startups

**Text:**

Imagine ordering a juicy steak au poivre, only to discover that it's actually made from imitation "meat" - cleverly recombined vegetable protein disguised as beef. While some might not mind the switch, traditionalists in France are up in arms over the idea. In February, the French government passed a decree requiring all meaty terms, such as entrecôte and jambon, to be reserved for cuts of dead animals only. The move has sparked outrage among vegan startups that produce cutting-edge faux flesh in Petri dishes.

In Europe, non-dairy substitutes are often referred to with awkward names like "soya drink" and "oatgurt." This nomenclature was imposed by farmers' lobbying in the 1980s. Today, supermarkets are filled with a wide range of vegan products, from burger patties to no-fish fingers. Big Farm has been trying to extend its grip on agricultural terms, even attempting to outlaw vegetarian sausages.

The French decree is just one example of this trend. Italy has earmarked "salami" for pork products, and Poland has considered a similar move. The battle over meat labels has raised questions about innovation and regulation in Europe.
