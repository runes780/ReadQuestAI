# The worldâ€™s first museum of homelessness _ Britain

Here is the revised text:

The Museum of Homelessness (MOH) in north London has opened its doors to the public for the first time, offering a glimpse into the lives of people who have experienced homelessness. The museum's collection includes over 7,000 objects donated by individuals and organizations that work with homeless people.

One actor recalled wearing a black plastic bag as a rain poncho during her time on the streets. Another actor pointed out the duct tape holding together "Fred's Trolley", a shopping trolley used to serve hot drinks to thousands of homeless people. Both actors have personal experiences with homelessness and are now part of the museum's opening exhibition.

According to Shelter, a charity, around 3,000 people in England sleep rough on any given night. However, their stories have been largely overlooked by cultural institutions until now. The MOH has been operating temporary exhibitions for over a decade and is now settled into its permanent home in Finsbury Park.

The museum's special exhibition, "How to Survive the Apocalypse", will also be open to the public from May 24th. Visitors can explore the museum's collection and learn more about the experiences of people who have been homeless.
