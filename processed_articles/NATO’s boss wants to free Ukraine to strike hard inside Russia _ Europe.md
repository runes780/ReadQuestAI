NATO's Chief Urges Easing Restrictions on Ukraine's Use of Western Weapons

Jens Stoltenberg, NATO's Secretary-General, has made a rare public criticism of the alliance's largest member country. In an interview with The Economist, he called for NATO allies to relax their rules on using Western weapons supplied to Ukraine. Specifically, he urged them to allow Ukraine to strike military targets inside Russia.

This bold move comes as Stoltenberg's ten-year tenure as Secretary-General is nearing its end. His comments are a clear challenge to the policy of US President Joe Biden, who has been controlling what Ukraine can and cannot attack with American- supplied systems.

Stoltenberg's statement may be seen as provocative by some, but he believes it is necessary to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia's aggression. The issue highlights the tension between NATO's commitment to supporting Ukraine and its desire to avoid direct conflict with Russia.
