Reading Comprehension Text:

Awareness days serve to remind individuals of important causes and desired behaviors. Different days throughout the year are dedicated to raising awareness for various issues, such as the International Day of Human Fraternity, World Day of Social Justice, and World Pulses Day. However, not all emotions are celebrated with special days. While anger is typically seen as objectionable and is often associated with negative outcomes, its role in the workplace can be more complex.

Anger can have both destructive and galvanizing effects. In the workplace, uncontrolled anger can create a hostile environment, hinder performance, and lead to negative outcomes. However, controlled displays of anger can be associated with decisiveness and competence, particularly in certain contexts like negotiations or team talks. Different personality types may also respond differently to anger, with disagreeable individuals sometimes benefiting from expressions of anger in certain situations.

The key to effectively utilizing anger in the workplace lies in moderation and control. While excessive anger can be detrimental, completely suppressing it may also have negative consequences. Finding a balance between expressing anger when necessary and maintaining professionalism is essential for navigating workplace dynamics.
