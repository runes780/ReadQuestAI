# California wants to protect indoor workers from heat. That goal is now in limbo

The state had been in the process of finalizing new regulations aimed at safeguarding the well-being of individuals employed in environments such as warehouses, particularly during periods of extreme heat. However, a sudden and unexpected change in plans has left workers uncertain about their safety as the hotter months approach.

The proposed rules were designed to establish specific guidelines and protocols that employers would need to follow to ensure the protection of their workers from the risks associated with working in high temperatures. These regulations would have included provisions such as mandatory rest breaks, access to water, and measures to monitor and manage heat exposure in the workplace.

Despite the extensive efforts made by labor advocates and health experts to push for these protective measures, a recent turn of events has cast doubt on whether the new rules will be implemented in time for the upcoming summer season. The uncertainty surrounding the situation has left workers anxious and concerned about their working conditions and safety.

As workers anxiously await further developments, the debate over the need for comprehensive heat protection measures continues. The potential impact of extreme heat on vulnerable workers has highlighted the urgency of addressing this issue and ensuring that adequate safeguards are in place to prevent heat-related illnesses and injuries in the workplace.
