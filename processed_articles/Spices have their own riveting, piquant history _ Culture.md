**Reading Passage**

The Spice of Life

Spices have their own riveting history. In the 16th century, two spices - nutmeg and cloves - were highly valued and sought after by European powers. These spices grew only on a few islands in the Malay Archipelago, known as the Spice Islands. The Portuguese were the first to muscle into the South-Asian spice trade, followed by the Spanish and English. In 1553, three ships left London on a journey to reach the Spice Islands via Russia and the Arctic. Although their voyage ended in disaster, their enthusiasm for spices is understandable.

As historian Roger Crowley explains, these spices had effects far beyond the kitchen, kindling revolutions in mapmaking and spycraft. For centuries, many were unsure about the origins of these spices. Marco Polo thought cloves came from China and nutmeg from Java. Crowley begins his story in 1511, when the Portuguese started to dominate the spice trade.
