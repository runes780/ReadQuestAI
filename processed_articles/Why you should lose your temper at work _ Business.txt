**Reading Comprehension Text:**

Awareness days are designated to bring attention to important causes and desirable behavior. Throughout the year, various days are celebrated to promote values and ideals. For example, February marks the observance of the International Day of Human Fraternity, World Day of Social Justice, and World Pulses Day. In March, the International Day of Happiness is celebrated, while World Kindness Day is recognized in November.

Despite the recognition of many positive traits, anger is not typically celebrated with its own special day. While there is an anger-awareness week in Britain, the focus is on managing and controlling anger rather than indulging in it. Anger, particularly in the workplace, has dual effects that are not always straightforward.

On one hand, anger can be disruptive and detrimental. Individuals who frequently display anger may create a hostile work environment, instill fear in their subordinates, and hinder open communication. Moreover, anger can lead to decreased productivity as individuals become consumed by negative emotions.

However, there are instances where controlled displays of anger can have positive outcomes. Research has shown that in certain situations, expressing anger can be associated with decisiveness and competence. Anger can serve as a motivator in specific circumstances, such as in sports halftime talks or negotiations, but moderation is key to prevent negative repercussions.

Ultimately, understanding the nuances of anger and its impact on individuals and organizations is essential for effective communication and decision-making in various settings.
