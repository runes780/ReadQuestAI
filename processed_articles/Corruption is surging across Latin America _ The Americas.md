# Corruption is surging across Latin America _ The Americas

In January 31st, José Dias Toffoli, a judge on Brazil’s Supreme Court, suspended the payment of a $2.6bn fine by Novonor, a construction firm better known by its former name, Odebrecht. The previous month he had suspended another fine imposed on J&F, which owns the world’s biggest meatpacking company, JBS. The companies had agreed to the fines as part of leniency agreements in which their executives admitted to bribing Brazilian officials. Mr Toffoli ruled that there was reasonable doubt about whether the agreements were signed voluntarily, and argued that the judge who administered the fines may have colluded with prosecutors.

The fines came after a series of Brazilian corruption investigations, the most famous of which, known as Lava Jato (Car Wash), started ten years ago this month. It was part of a wave of anti-corruption activity which swept Latin America in the 2010s. But Mr Toffoli’s decisions correspond with a new worsening of perceptions of corruption across the region. Brazil fell ten places in an annual index of perceived corruption released by Transparency International, a charity, in January. Peru fell 20 places, putting it among the countries perceived to be the most corrupt in the world. Most Latin American countries scored worse than their levels of development suggest they should.

Perceptions are not always reliable, but there is other evidence of a backlash against anti-corruption efforts. In November allies of Honduras’s new president bypassed congress to name an attorney general who is friendly to the ruling party. As The Economist went to press, Peru’s congress was set to vote on whether to remove members of the independent body that selects prosecutors and judges, even as numerous legislators are currently under investigation for corruption.
