# AI models can improve corner-kick tactics _ Science & technology

In the world of artificial intelligence (AI) at Google DeepMind, corner kicks in football are seen as strategic opportunities akin to games of chess. With the potential to revolutionize the game through AI technology, researchers have been exploring the use of AI models to enhance corner-kick tactics. By analyzing vast amounts of data collected from elite players, including metrics like heart rate, position, and performance statistics, researchers have developed a graph neural network (GNN) model to predict player behavior during corner kicks with impressive accuracy.

Coaches worldwide are eager to leverage these advancements in AI technology to gain a competitive edge in the sport. The ability of AI-generated tactics to match, and sometimes surpass, those developed by human coaches is a promising development. By processing data from thousands of corner kicks and identifying patterns in player behavior, the AI model can offer valuable insights and suggest innovative strategies for improving performance on the field.

Despite the complexities of football tactics and the unique challenges presented during matches, corner kicks stand out as a predictable aspect of the game that can be optimized through targeted training and strategic planning. The success of teams like Arsenal, who have capitalized on scoring opportunities from corner kicks, underscores the importance of mastering these set pieces.

As AI technology continues to evolve and demonstrate its potential in enhancing sports performance, researchers like To Zhe Wang are exploring how these advancements can be applied beyond the realm of football. By utilizing football as a testing ground for AI technologies, the hope is to develop solutions that can be beneficial in other fields such as healthcare and defense.

In summary, the marriage of AI and football represents a promising frontier in sports technology, offering new insights and strategies to elevate performance on the field.
